    <h1>Welcome to My Lightweight Data Parser</h1>
    <p>This particular Data Parser is not for everyone because of it's unique properties, it is a very simple JS that allows specific user to use it because of these user might have the formatted text block in which the Data Parser were meant to be used for. I don't know what to say but it kind of like that nothing special about it, if you insist to try it, feel free to do it.</p>
